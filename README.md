## Overview

This is my submission for my ninth Frontend Mentor Project, built with HTML/CSS and Javascript. A newsletter sign-up form that validates the email input by the user, as well as displays a success message with a successful email submission.

## My process

I got pretty lost in the sauce on this project if i'm being completely honest. I started with HTML structure like i always do, but moving on to the CSS was a little rough, having to consider incorporating JS for the functionality, so after doing some styling, i decided to go without it and get my JS logic working with the HTML first. Aside from using display properties to hide the different sections for testing, I saved my CSS styling for last.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- JavaScript

### What I learned

This project really stressed the importance of figuring out a proper work flow. I kept finding myself going back and forth between the styling and the logic and HTML having to make proper adjustments for each change that was made in any of the code. I'm definitely coming back from this with a better idea of how to approach building all aspects of the project.

### Continued development

I plan on spending more time working on my critical thinking and problem solving skills by testing myself on leetcode, as well as testing out JS logic for myself. While I generally prefer to deepen my expertise in a select few programs rather than spread myself too thin, I am eager to start working with libraries more in the future. I'm seeking web design tips that will enable me to minimize time spent on styling so I can focus more on functionality.
